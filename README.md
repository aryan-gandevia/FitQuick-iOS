# FitQuick
An application where users can track their best lifts, and face-off against other users or the world and see how they place!


## Demo
Below will show different screen states of the application showing its features and program flow - in GIFs!

## Inspiration
Every workout app I've come across always serves the same functionality: track your workout and time yourself. However, there was never somewhere to store and compare your lifts to another user, or see how you place against
the general population. This app aims to cater to this niche, and give a competative spin on working out! Face off against your friends or general population data, and see how much you can improve, until you are the very
strongest!


## Local Development
This application was developed on Xcode version 14.3.1, and uses Google Firebase's Firestore database. To create your own local instance:
- Go to https://firebase.google.com/firebase-and-gcp, log into your Google account and go to console
- Create a new project and follow the steps for an iOS project
- Clone this repository onto your local machine
- Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file, and paste it into the `Other` folder of the codebase


## Future Developments
- Add more lift options
- Add a section that gives information on each type of lift, a graphic of what it targets, to help new users
- Track your workout (low priority)
- Leaderboard between all users
- Friends function
